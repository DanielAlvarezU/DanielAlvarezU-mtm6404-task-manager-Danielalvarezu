# D-NAL Task Manager

This is my **Capstone Iteration 3** project for the **Web Applications** course.  
It’s a **Task Manager** built with **React 18** and **Vite**.

## What does it do?

- Lets you **add tasks** with text and a priority (High, Medium, or Low).
- Tasks are shown **sorted by priority**.
- You can **mark tasks as complete or incomplete**.
- You can **delete tasks**.
- There’s a button to **show or hide completed tasks**.
- Everything is saved in **`localStorage`**, so tasks stay even if you refresh.
- The app is **responsive**, so it looks good on desktop and mobile.

## How does it work?

It uses **React components** like `Navbar`, `TaskForm`, `TaskList`, `TaskItem`, `Footer`, and `Card`.  
It has **conditional rendering**, **list rendering**, and uses **props** and the **children prop** to keep things organized.

## Technologies

- React 18
- Vite
- HTML5 & CSS3

## Notes

This project is part of the **MTM6404 Web Applications** course.  
Built by **Daniel Alvarez U.** to practice **event handlers, state, props, localStorage**, and reusable components.
